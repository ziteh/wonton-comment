# Yang Chun Comment

A simple and private comment system, runs on Cloudflare Workers.

- No login
- No cookie
- No browser fingerprinting (if you don't think the hashed IP is a fingerprint)

## Architecture

This monorepo contains three packages:

- `server`: Backend API built with Hono for Cloudflare Workers
- `client`: Frontend widget, outputs ESM and UMD bundles
- `shared`: Common TypeScript types and utilities

## Usage

### Server ENV

- `HMAC_SECRET_KEY` - A random string used for HMAC token generation. Select a long and strong random string.
- `CORS_ORIGIN` - The allowed origin for CORS requests.

For **development**, create a `.dev.vars` file in the `server/` directory:

```env
# .dev.vars

HMAC_SECRET_KEY=your-very-long-and-secure-random-string-here
CORS_ORIGIN=*
```

For **production**, use Cloudflare Workers Environment Variables or Secret.

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build shared types (required before starting client/server)
pnpm build:shared

# Start development servers
pnpm dev
```

### Individual Package Development

```bash
# Client development
cd client 
pnpm dev

# Server development  
cd server
pnpm dev

# Shared types development (watch mode)
cd shared
pnpm dev
```

## Building for Production

```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Or build individually
pnpm build:shared  # Build shared types first
pnpm build:client  # Build client library
```

## Using the Client Library

After building, the client package outputs two formats in `client/dist/`:

- **ES Module**: `yangchun-comment.es.js`
- **UMD**: `yangchun-comment.umd.js`

Take ESM for example

```js
import { initYangchunComment } from './path/to/yangchun-comment.es.js';

initYangchunComment('ycc-app', {
  post: window.location.pathname,
  apiUrl: 'https://your-api-url.com/',
});
```

## Deployment

```bash
# Deploy server to Cloudflare Workers
cd server
pnpm deploy
```
## TODO

- [ ] Using PoW (proof of work) to replace IP-based bot attack prevention to reduce the impact on different users with the same IP address, and further eliminate the need to store IP hash values on the backend server (storing hashed IPs may be considered a lightweight user tracking method)
